# Packet-sniffer
 Developed a basic packet sniffer tool using python with scapy module.

 Implemented Port scanning and Captured the web request(http) in a host and analyzed the raw data packets. 

 Sniffed the login and password fields using the scapy python module.


Scapy module: 

Scapy is a powerful packet manipulation program that can be used interactively. It can forge or decode packets from a variety of protocols, send them over the network, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. Most traditional tasks, such as scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks, and network discovery, are easily handled (it can replace hping, 85 percent of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tshark, p0f, etc.). It also excels at a variety of other tasks that most other tools struggle with, such as sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining techniques (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channels,...), and so on.
